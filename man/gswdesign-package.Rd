\title{gswdesign: The Gram-Schmidt walk design}
\description{
Provides wrappers for the Julia package 'GSWDesign', which is a fast
implementation of the Gram--Schmidt Walk for balancing covariates in
randomized experiments. The Gram--Schmidt Walk design allows experimenters
the flexibilty to control the amount of covariate balancing.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{sample_gs_walk}} for the main function.
